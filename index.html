                "I'm passionate about technology and the hospitality industry. My previous work experience has been primarily in the hospitality and supermarket sectors, but recently, I took a bold step by joining a bootcamp where I acquired skills in HTML, CSS, and am currently immersed in learning JavaScript. My enthusiasm for technology has driven me to seek opportunities in the tech world. My goal is to grow in areas such as web design, machine learning, cybersecurity, data analysis, and blockchain. I am committed to learning and growing in this field, and my determination motivates me to reinvent myself and explore new opportunities."
